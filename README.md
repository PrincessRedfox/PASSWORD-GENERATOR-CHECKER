# PASSWORD-GENERATOR-CHECKER

PROBLEM
A password is secret data, typically a string of characters, usually used to confirm a user's identity. You are to design an algorithm for your own password generator/checker with the following requirements:

•	To ask the user for information.
•	To give an option to either generate a password from the information input by the user.
•	To give an option to check if a password input by the user is valid.

The program will ask for the same information from each user e.g. post code, surname, date of birth, year of entry etc.

The generated password must be a set length, include upper and lower case characters (letters and digits) and a randomly generated symbol from:

! exclamation point	" double quotation	# number sign
$ dollar sign	% percent sign	& ampersand
' apostrophe	( left parenthesis	) right parenthesis
* asterisk	+ plus sign	, comma
- hyphen	. full stop	/ slash

Your programmed password generator/checker should contain string manipulation functions.
 
Your programmed password generator/checker should also include all three programming constructs:
•	Sequence
•	Selection
•	Iteration
Your program should:
•	prompt the user to enter their information.
•	offer the user the choice of generating a password or checking if an entered password is valid.
•	generate/check password as appropriate
•	output the result.
